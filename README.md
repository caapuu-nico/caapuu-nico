Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nicolas Del Vecchio.

I am a junior programmer, and I am 28 years old. I have experience in developing both group and individual applications.

When I'm not studying or programming, I enjoy listening to music and creating it as a hobby. I also play football in my free time in my neighborhood.

I've always felt uncertainty and curiosity about the development of web pages that I frequently use. Today, I can confidently say that I provide solutions, and I am passionate about creating and continuously learning in this vast field.

I'm always in a state of constant learning!
